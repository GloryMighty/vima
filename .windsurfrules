Reference the project rules in Readme.MD, TranslationImplementation.md, LanguageCurrent.md, Current.md, Documentation.md
Instead of next.config.js we use next.config.mjs. Please remember it. 
Our middleware file is written as middleware.ts which means on typescript, instead of javascript. Please remember it. 
Our translation is going good and there are only few adjustments for english localization left. Please try to reference other locales from [locale] folder to understand the logic and use the same logic of keywords for english locale. 
Always reference the mentioned earlier rules and basics.
