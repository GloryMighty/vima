The main point right now is to update the documentation. Reference the newest updates regarding localization and pages , mostly from /app folder.
Instead of next.config.js we use next.config.mjs. Please remember it. 
Our middleware file is written as middleware.ts which means on typescript, instead of javascript. Please remember it. Our navigation is located in config/navigation.ts. Please reference it when needed.
Our translation is going good and there are only few adjustments for english localization left. Please try to reference other locales from [locale] folder to understand the logic and use the same logic of keywords for english locale. 
Remember that the main logic of our application is based on the localized pages, mainly from /app/[locale] folder.
Always reference the mentioned earlier rules and basics. 
Our main styling is defined in /styles , /css folders. 
Always consider mobile responsive design, therefore do not use overflow for any layout and any elements.
Don't be lazy when it's coming to investigation of changes and errors.
