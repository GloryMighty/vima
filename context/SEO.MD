1. Keyword Research and Mapping
Conduct thorough keyword research to identify relevant terms that potential clients might use to find web development services. Utilize tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, or Ahrefs to discover keywords with high search volume and low competition.

Focus on Long-Tail Keywords: Given the specialized services offered (e.g., AI integration, multilingual solutions), long-tail keywords can attract more qualified traffic. For example, phrases like "custom web applications in Turkey" or "AI-powered web solutions in Finland" may yield better results.

Create a Keyword Sitemap: Map selected keywords to specific pages on your website. This ensures that each page targets a unique keyword or set of keywords, enhancing overall site optimization and clarity for search engines24.

2. Generate Specific Keywords
Using the identified topics, generate specific keywords and phrases. Consider both short-tail and long-tail keywords to capture a broader audience. Here are some examples:
