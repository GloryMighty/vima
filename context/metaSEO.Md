Best Practices for Metadata Implementation
Limit Character Count: Ensure meta keywords are concise (150â€“160 characters per page).

Avoid Keyword Stuffing: Use only relevant keywords naturally aligned with the content.

Dynamic Keywords: Use tools like AI-based SEO generators to refine keywords over time based on analytics.

Localized Keywords: For global presence, include location-specific terms like "web agency in Finland" or "custom websites in Turkey."

Regular Updates: Revisit metadata periodically to align with changing trends or business focus.
